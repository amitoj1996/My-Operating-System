# My-Operating-System
This is my 3rd year(B. Tech.) project in which I will be creating a basic operating system. Special thanks to Viktor Engelmann for his awesome tutorials at youtube. Make sure to check out his channel https://youtu.be/1rnA6wpF0o4?list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M. 
In this project I will be creating a base kernel, global descriptor table(gdt), interrupt descriptor table, communication with hardware ports, keyboard, mouse, PCI(Peripheral Component Interconnect), Graphics mode(VGA), Desktop and Windows, Multi-tasking, Dynamic Memory Management(Heap), Networking, HardDrives and some system calls. Other things will be added later.
I will be writing this OS in C++ and assembler(x86) and a good knowledge of both is needed to start this project specially pointers!
Let's Start!
